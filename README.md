HashTable
=========
Testing and optimizing different verions of hash functions

Description
-----------

Studying task, which includes two parts: 
1. Comparing different hash functions 
2. Using different optimizing methods to increase performance of work with hash table

In this task list structure used, that is made by me previously. [List structure here](https://github.com/RustamSubkhankulov/list "List Structure")

First part. Comparing hash functions
------------------------------------

Second part. Optimizing performance
-----------------------------------
